## Overview:
GitHubConnect is a solo project that re-imagines how attendees can connect at hackathons. In just 48 hours, I leveraged the GitHub API to create an interactive social graph, connecting participants based on their GitHub contributions. This project bridges the gap between code and community, fostering new connections among participants through a down-to-earth and innovative approach.

## Features:
**GitHub Integration:** I collected GitHub usernames from every attendee and used the GitHub API to extract valuable data, including repositories, contributions, and collaborations.

**Graph Generation:** An intelligent algorithm connects attendees who contributed to the same projects, creating an intricate social graph that showcases diverse skills and interests within the event.

**Real-time Visualization:** The project employs plain HTML and JavaScript to provide an immersive, responsive visualization that updates dynamically as attendees interact and contribute.

**Interactivity:** Attendees can click on nodes to explore GitHub profiles, see common projects, and even send messages or connection requests, all within an intuitive user interface.

## Why GitHubConnect Stands Out:
**Innovative Use of GitHub:** GitHubConnect takes GitHub beyond code hosting, transforming it into a tool for social interaction and networking.

**Community Building:** This project fosters meaningful connections by highlighting shared interests and projects, making hackathons more about the community.

**Real-time Engagement:** The dynamic graph keeps participants engaged and encourages them to discover new collaborators, projects, and ideas.

## Categories:
**Best Visualization:** GitHubConnect's dynamic, real-time social graph offers a visually appealing and unique experience for attendees.

**Best Solo Hack:** Developed solo within 48 hours, GitHubConnect showcases creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills.
 
**Most Creative Use of GitHub:** GitHubConnect pushes the boundaries of GitHub's capabilities, creatively enabling connections and collaboration.
